	<p>The current document is an outline of the Matlab Audio Analysis Library which accompanies the book <a href="http://store.elsevier.com/Introduction-to-Audio-Analysis/Theodoros-Giannakopoulos/isbn-9780080993881/" target="_blank">Introduction to Audio Analysis:A MATLAB&#174 Approach, 1st Edition</a>. 
	<p>The provided material is organized as follows::
	 
	<ul>
	<li>Folder "library"</li>
		<ul>
		<li>In the root of this folder you can find:
			<ul>
			<li> the <b>core m-files</b> of the Matlab Audio Analysis Library</li>
